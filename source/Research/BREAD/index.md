Over the summer I worked on the [BREAD Collaboration](https://inspirehep.net/experiments/1988644) in order to help them test their highly polished reflector. The BREAD project is currently trying to detect axions (a potential dark matter particle) by converting them into photons under a strong electromagnetic field and using this reflector to reflect the photons onto a small superconducting nanowire single-photon detector.

## Presentation

Unfortunately I did not have time to prepare a paper this summer. I presented about my research at the [2024 QuarkNet Teachers' Workshop](https://quarknet.org/document/quarknet-teachers-workshop-2024-cosmic-ray-workshop).

Before my presentation, Stefan Knirck gave [a quick presentation about the BREAD project](knirck_stefan_axion_dm_compressed.pdf). You should view that first, as it gives a good overview of the BREAD project. My presentation slides are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Kp5wg_Y_1K9K7YAmVEMYk9oemANW6cX7wL_Fz-80k3M/edit) -- I explained most of my work in that presentation.
